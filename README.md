# ComputerGraphics_FactorySceneConstruction

This project used OpenGL and C++ to build a factory scene, applying knowledge from computer graphics to implement a particle system, lighting, and operations like turning lights on and off.

### Introduction

To ensure a stylized scene, I sourced a comprehensive 3D model of a vacuum heat treatment furnace and then used Blender to divide it into three parts: Control Box, Diffusion Pump and Roots Blower, and Vacuum Brazing Furnace.

I found a model of a trolley on Sketchfab, as its rusty material texture aligns with my conceptualization of the scene. The workshop model originates  from an asset I previously used in game development, which I found  very suitable for this context.

I aimed to recreate an old vacuum heat treatment workshop and tried to accurately represent the scene as specified in the project requirements. Initially, I searched for relevant model resources on the internet. Then, in Blender, I performed segmentation and stylization, such as adding a rusty texture. After segmentation, I checked their UV maps to ensure there would be no texture errors when imported into OpenGL.Subsequently, I constructed the desired scene in Blender, including the arrangement of models and lighting setup.
